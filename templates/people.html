					<h4><a href="mailto:gsteinobrien@gmail.com" target="_top">Genevieve Stein-O'Brien, PhD, MHS</a> --
						<a href="https://kavlijhu.org/" target="_blank"> </a> PI
					</h4>
					<p>Dr. Stein-O'Brien is an Assistant Professor in <a href="https://neuroscience.jhu.edu/">the
							Neuroscience Department</a> at Johns Hopkins University with affiliations in the Brain
						Science Institute, the Division of Quantitative Sciences in the Department of Oncology, <a
							href="https://igm.jhmi.edu/">the McKusick-Nathans Department of Genomics Medicine </a>, the
						Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science and <a href="https://kavlijhu.org/">the
							Kavli Neuroscience Discovery Institute </a>. Dr. Stein-O'Brien's research is focused on the
						stochastic processes underlying gene regulation in dynamic biological systems. Specifically, she
						develops computational, statistical, and molecular methods for pattern recognition, latent space
						detection, and data integration in high-throughput omics.</p>

					<h4><a href="#" target="_top">Zachary Nicholas</a> -- PhD Candidate, Human Genetics and Genomics
					</h4>
					<p>Zachary is a PhD candidate in the Human Genetics and Genomics predoctoral training program at the
						Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He did his undergraduate studies at the University
						of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) where he earned his bachelor's degree in Anthropology.
						During his time at UMBC, he conducted both anthropological and biological research. In 2020, he
						embarked on his path to acquiring his
						Ph.D., joining the lab of Dr. Genevieve Stein-O'Brien. He was selected as an NIH All of Us
						Research Scholar for the 2023-2024 cohort and was also
						selected in 2024 as a NIH Neuroscience DSPAN Scholar. He conducts research investigating genetic
						variants associated with insomnia, in addition to his thesis work. His thesis focuses on
						investigating how changes to neural progenitor cell cycle dynamics, external signaling, and
						localization alter fate determination and gene expression in
						the developing cerebral cortex using molecular biology, transcriptomic, and computational
						methods.</p>

					</h4>
					<p>Iâ€™m an aspiring researcher in machine learning interpretability and disentanglement. I develop methods to probe biological deep learning models internal representations to learn how they are making predictions. This helps us ensure that our models align with our scientific goals and extract novel biological insights. </p>
