									    <h4><a href="mailto:loyalgoff@jhmi.edu" target="_top">Loyal Goff</a> -- Principal Investigator</h4>
									   	<p>Dr. Goff is an Assistant Professor of Neuroscience in the <a href="https://igm.jhmi.edu/">McKusick-Nathans Department of Genetic Medicine</a> at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. His postdoctoral work was conducted under the joint mentorship of Drs. John Rinn (Harvard, SCRB) and Manolis Kellis (MIT, CSAIL) and involved the discovery, annotation, and characterization of long non-coding RNAs in a variety of cellular and developmental contexts. The Goff lab is currently focused on the roles of long noncoding RNAs on neural cell fate decisions and the application of single cell RNA-Sequencing to elucidate the developmental hierarchies during neuronal specification.</p>

										<h4><a href="mailto:gsteinobrien@gmail.com" target="_top">Genevieve Stein-O'Brien, Ph.D.</a> -- Postdoctoral Fellow</h4>
										 <p>Dr. Stein-O'Brien is a post doctoral fellow in Oncology Biostatics and Bioinformatics and Neuroscience Departments at Johns Hopkins University with affiliations in the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genomics Medicine and Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science. In 2017, she received a PhD in Human Genetics from Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and a MHS in Biostatistics from Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. Dr. Stein-O'Brien's research is focused on the stochastic processes underlying gene regulation in dynamic biological systems. Specifically, she develops computational and statistical methods for pattern detection and data integration in high-throughput genomics.</p>

									    <h4><a href="mailto:jaugust7@jhmi.edu" target="_top">Jonathan Augustin</a> -- Ph.D. Candidate, Biochemistry, Cellular and Molecular Biology Graduate Program; NSF Graduate Fellow</h4>
									     <p>Jonathan is a graduate student in the BCMB program. Prior to joining our lab, he was a research technician in the lab of Dr. Hao Jiang at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.  He did his undergraduate work at Maryville College in Tennessee where he earned his B.A. in Biochemistry, and a minor in Mathematics.  Jonathan's current work involves development of both high-throughput, and classical biochemical assays to query the functional roles for lncRNAs in directing neural differentiation.</p>

									     <p>Liz joined the Human Genetics program in August 2015 after receiving her B.A. in Chemistry from Yale University. Her undergraduate thesis involved a genetic study of a trio of individuals to identify a causal variant for a specific neurological disorder. She brings with her experience in both experimental and computation biology.  Her current projects include a characterization of newborn enteric neurons in a mouse model of Hirschsprung Disease.</p>

Whilst an undergrad, she retained membership in various honor societies, such as, Beta Beta Beta, Gamma Sigma Epsilon, and Sigma Xi. She was also highly involved in the Phi Sigma Sigma sorority. She completed a Capstone Research Project at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health under the mentorship of Dr. Janice Evans. This project focused on optimizing antibody conditions for determining protein localization within mouse oocytes. Briana also participated in a semester long course, at her alma mater, doing research on the role of ubiquitination and its' effect on stem cell differentiation and lineage determination. While she hopes to contribute her knowledge and dedication to our lab, she remains focused on her goal of becoming an Embryologist in the near future. </p>-->
