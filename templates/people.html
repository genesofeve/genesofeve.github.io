   	<p>Dr. Goff is an Assistant Professor of Neuroscience in the <a href="https://igm.jhmi.edu/">McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine</a> at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. His postdoctoral work was conducted under the joint mentorship of Drs. John Rinn (Harvard, SCRB) and Manolis Kellis (MIT, CSAIL) and involved the discovery, annotation, and characterization of long non-coding RNAs in a variety of cellular and developmental contexts. The Goff lab is currently focused on the roles of long noncoding RNAs on neural cell fate decisions and the application of single cell RNA-Sequencing to elucidate the developmental hierarchies during neuronal specification.</p>
