						<a href="https://kavlijhu.org/" target="_blank"> </a> PI
					</h4>
					<p>Dr. Stein-O'Brien is an Assistant Professor in <a href="https://neuroscience.jhu.edu/">the
							Neuroscience Department</a> at Johns Hopkins University with affiliations in the Brain
						Science Institute, the Division of Quantitative Sciences in the Department of Oncology, <a
							href="https://igm.jhmi.edu/">the McKusick-Nathans Department of Genomics Medicine </a>, the
						Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science and <a href="https://kavlijhu.org/">the
							Kavli Neuroscience Discovery Institute </a>. Dr. Stein-O'Brien's research is focused on the
						stochastic processes underlying gene regulation in dynamic biological systems. Specifically, she
						develops computational, statistical, and molecular methods for pattern recognition, latent space
						detection, and data integration in high-throughput omics.</p>

					<h4><a href="#" target="_top">Zachary Nicholas</a> -- PhD Candidate, Human Genetics and Genomics
					</h4>
					<p>Zachary is a PhD candidate in the Human Genetics and Genomics predoctoral training program at the
						Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. He did his undergraduate studies at the University
						of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) where he earned his bachelor's degree in Anthropology.
						During his time at UMBC, he conducted both anthropological and biological research. In 2020, he
						embarked on his path to acquiring his
						Ph.D., joining the lab of Dr. Genevieve Stein-O'Brien. He was selected as an
						<a href="https://www.researchallofus.org/" target="_blank"> NIH All of Us</a>
						Research Scholar for the 2023-2024 cohort and was also
						selected in 2024 as a NIH Neuroscience DSPAN Scholar. He conducts research investigating genetic
						variants associated with insomnia, in addition to his thesis work. His thesis focuses on
						investigating how changes to neural progenitor cell cycle dynamics, external signaling, and
						localization alter fate determination and gene expression in
						the developing cerebral cortex using molecular biology, transcriptomic, and computational
						methods.

					</h4>
					<p>Richard is a PhD candidate in the Neuroscience Training Program at Johns Hopkins University. He
						received his Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree from Duke University. His research
						focuses on investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying brain development using spatial and
						high-throughput single-cell transcriptomics methods. He is the lead developer of the <a
							href="https://samuibrowser.com/" target="_blank">Samui browser</a>, a tool for visualizing
						and analyzing spatial transcriptomics data.</p>

					<h4><a href="mailto:psteve11@jh.edu" target="_top"> Parker Stevenson</a> -- PhD Candidate, BCMB
					</h4>
					<p>Parker Stevenson is a PhD candidate in the Biochemistry, Cellular, & Molecular Biology (BCMB)
						predoctoral training program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHUSOM). She
						completed her bachelor's degree at the University of Tennessee Knoxville, where she
						double-majored in Neuroscience and BCMB. During her undergraduate, she conducted cellular-level
						research on an X-linked neurodevelopmental disease. She was accepted as a Post-baccalaureate
						IRTA Fellow at the National Institute of Mental Health, where she performed systems-level
						neuroscience research in the Unit on Functional Neural Circuits. She began her graduate career
						at JHUSOM in 2022, and she joined the Stein-O'Brien lab for her thesis work investigating gene
						signatures of collectively invasive mammary epithelial cells -- both in the context of healthy
						glandular development and early metastasis -- using *in silico* transfer learning, single-cell
						resolution spatial and sequencing technologies, and *ex vivo* organoid assays.</p>

					<h4><a href="#" target="_top"> David Zhou</a> -- Undergraduate, Neuroscience
					</h4>
					<p>David Zhou is a third-year undergraduate at Hopkins studying neuroscience and applied
						mathematics. His primary research interests lie in understanding the pathways that guide the
						nervous system as it develops, and subsequently, how various mechanisms of error and
						dysregulation can disrupt these pathways. Currently, he is working in the Stein-O'Brien Lab to
						develop a computational model of murine cerebrocortical development as a medium for hypothesis
						testing alternative to conventional in-vivo methods.</p>

					<h4><a href="mailto:kreid20@jh.edu" target="_top"> Kendall Reid</a> -- PhD Candidate, BCMB
					</h4>
					<p>Iâ€™m an aspiring researcher in machine learning interpretability and disentanglement. I develop methods to probe biological deep learning models internal representations to learn how they are making predictions. This helps us ensure that our models align with our scientific goals and extract novel biological insights. </p>
